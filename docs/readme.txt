Major Challenges:
- Parsing the API. The students API project we were given were parsing a very simple API.
- Unable to use DateTime, string[] to be the attribute type for PublishedDate and Authors.
This is not a requirement for the assignment but it would be nice to use the type that best represent the respective attributes.

Testing notes:
login with the following credential:
Email: a@a.a
Password: P@$$w0rd

If the above credential does not work for some strange reason,
Go register one and use that one instead.
